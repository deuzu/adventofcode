# Advent Of Code

Each folder contains an Advent Of Code exercise.

## Solve an exercise

The exercises live inside `src/lib.rs` and are solved by executing test suite:

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

Benches for part 1 & 2 are available at `benches/bench.rs`.

```sh
cargo bench
```

*For `day1|2|3`, the exercises are located in `src/main.rs`, are solved by executing `cargo run` and no benches available =(*
